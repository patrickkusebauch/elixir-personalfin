# Personal finance management - Elixir demo project

This is not a production ready application by no means.

It is just a project I used to learn Elixir/Phoenix.

For it to have practical application, I decided to track my personal finances including, but limited to:
 - Bank Account balances (via API)
 - Bank transactions (via API)
 - Monthly income and expenses
 - Status of investment fonds
 - Status of stocks
 - Future projection of all investments

All of this with the goal to be able to calculate the FIRE date.

I hope you find it entertaining. :)

### Development

To start your server:
 - copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill in the values
